I am a passionate developer based in Montreal, Canada. Nowadays, my focus is on PHP applications based on Laravel and Vue.js, but I am also interested in DevOps, the AWS platform, and the cloud in general. I also do Android development from time to time.

Open-source software is really important for me, so I try to give back to the community as much as I can by creating new packages, sharing the knowledge I have on my blog, submitting pull requests or reporting bugs.
